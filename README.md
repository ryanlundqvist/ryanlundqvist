ðŸŽ“ I'm a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, concentrating in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in machine learning research, agent safety, interpretability, human-agent interaction, linguistics/nlp, and mathematics.

ðŸ’» Professionally, I have been an engineer with experience in an intersection of backend, data, interfaces, and machine learning. Previously, I worked at Amazon on Elastic Cloud Compute.

ðŸ”¬ I'm also interested in computing research! Currently, I'm working on creating fingerspelling sign language recognition models for the PopSignAI application, in partnership with Google Accessibility Research. Previously, I worked on the SnakeCLEF competition, created models for recognizing snake species which were published in CLEF2024. I also worked for a while on platforms for generative AI research.
